#User Authentication Page


--> If The user wants to log-in to the page he will enter the respective 
     credentials and enter into page.
     Initially username and password are admin and admin.

--> If the user Forgets the password he will press the Forget Password button.

--> If the user enters the correct details an alert will be generarted either success
    or failure.

--> if the user wnats to enter again and again he selects Remember me option.

-->if the user wants to abort the log-in he selects Cancel Button.

This is just a basic login page,without any Redirections of buttons,and If i have
some more time to do so i can also add some redirections of buttons like cancel and 
forgot password.
